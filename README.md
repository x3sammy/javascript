## All the codes are written in pure JS. I love to build something from scratch without any framework.
Simply open the choosen file in the broweser.

* ##### *Number Game.html*:- This Script will let you play a number game in which you have to guess the number in the give time you can modify the time limits in case you want!
---
* ##### *replace.js*:- This Script will Allow you to replace any word from the script within the counter limit.

example:-

repx(rval,val,rep,count);

rval: string;
val: the word you want to replace;
rep: the replacing word;
count: how many words you want to modify from the starting of the string(optional);

---
* ##### *toUcWords.js*:- toUcWords Function allows you to make first letter of the word in upper case since, the function is missing in js.
